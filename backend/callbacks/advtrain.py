"""Generic adversarial-training callback for Ultralytics YOLOv8.

This callback can be registered via ``model.add_callback`` so that a fraction of
each training batch is replaced by adversarial examples generated *on-the-fly*
by any attack class that inherits :class:`algorithms.attacks.base.BaseAttack`.

Example
-------
>>> from ultralytics import YOLO
>>> from algorithms.attacks.pgd import PGDAttack
>>> from backend.callbacks.advtrain import AdvTrainingCallback
>>> model = YOLO("yolov8s.pt")
>>> attack = PGDAttack(eps=8/255, alpha=2/255, steps=10)
>>> model.add_callback("on_train_batch_start", AdvTrainingCallback(attack, ratio=0.5).on_batch_start)

    ----------
